                The Government of India launched National Action Plan for
                Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2008. The main objective of this program was to
                attain the national development goals while also addressing the rising threat
                of climate change and maintaining ecological sustainability. This action plan
                was planned to be executed through Eight missions. Among these Eight missions

                “National Solar Mission” was one of the most important and forward-looking
                programs. This mission is still being continued and is governed by the Ministry
                of New and Renewable Energy.

            <h2>Current Status</h2>
            <p>National Solar Mission was launched in 2010 under the National Action Plan on Climate Change. Being India a tropical country, we have an abundance of sunlight sufficient to produce a good quantity of Solar Energy. The initial target of the mission was to achieve a Solar power capacity of 20GW by 2022. However, this target was increased to install 100GW grid-connected solar power plants by 2022.</p><br/>
            <p>This Solar power generation can be mainly divided into two parts.</p>
            <h2>1. Off-grid Solar PV program-</h2>
            <p>Under the National Solar Mission, the target of 2000 MWp was kept for off-grid solar PV applications.  Under the Phase-I of the Mission from 2010-13, a target of 200 MWp was kept against which 253 MWp was sanctioned, and under Phase-II from 2013 – 17, a target of 500 MWp was kept against which 713 MWp has been sanctioned.<br/>

                Following are some data regarding the off-grid application of Solar energy-</p>

            <h2>2. Grid Connected</h2>
            <h3>
                Solar Power:-
            </h3>
            <p>
                In order to achieve the target of 100GW grid-connected solar
                power by 2022, several initiatives have been taken like Solar Park Scheme, VGF Schemes, CPSU Schemes,
                Defence Scheme, Canal Bank & Canal Top Scheme, Bundle scheme, etc. India is currently at 5th position in solar
                power deployment. We can observe the Cumulative capacity increase during the
                last decade in the figure below.

            <h2>Initiatives:-</h2>
            <p>
                Now pointing out some of the recent initiatives taken by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy in the Solar Sector-
            </p>
            <h3>60.61 Lakh Solar Study Lamps</h3>
            <p>distributed to the School going Students in the less electrified areas of Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh. Also, under this scheme- 832 new Solar Shops have been opened, and 7436 women were trained as Solar technicians who were involved in the assembly of these lamps.</p>
            <h3>Scale-Up of Access to Clean Energy Scheme</h3>
            <p>This scheme aimed to enhance the use of reliable and affordable renewable energy for improving the livelihoods of rural people in sectors like poultry, fishery, horticulture, dairy, etc. Some examples may include - Solar PV Lighting System and Ventilation for Backyard Poultry Farm, Solar PV System for Milk Chilling at Milk Collection Centres, Solar Dryers for drying spices, vegetables, and fruits, Solar Fish Dryers, Biogas Plant based on Cattle Dung for captive use, etc. <br/>
                This project was to be implemented in Assam, Madhya Pradesh, and Odisha with a target of 30000 beneficiaries.</p>
                <h3>Atal Jyoti Yojna (AJAY) - PHASE II</h3>
                <p>This scheme will cover the installation of Solar Street Lights in - Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, the North Eastern States including Sikkim, Andaman & Nicobar, and Lakshadweep</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                It is evident from the data that India has been improved significantly in building solar energy capacity in the past decade. However, it is still far away from the target of installed solar energy capacity is 100 GW by March 2023 — 40 GW rooftop solar and 60 GW ground-mounted utility-scale. We have managed to install only 43.94 GW till July 31, 2021, according to the CEA(Central Electricity Authority) data. The rooftop solar installation has been particularly dismal at 7GW till December 2020, according to Bridge to India, a renewable energy consultancy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides this, we also need to focus on improving greater and quicker financing and funding for the Research and Manufacturing of solar projects and products. This may include low-interest loans to manufacturers, initial financing support for household users, revising the framework for quick decision-making both in the public and private sector, and of course, building public awareness
