                            The need of the hour is to show concrete and collective resolve to ensure peace, harmony and security in the world. I am confident that next year when the G20 meets in the holy land of Buddha and Gandhi, we will all agree to convey a strong message of peace to the world.

                    <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the 2022 Bali G20 Summit in Indonesia. As India has taken the responsibility to preside over G20, let’s have a deeper look into it. </p>
                        <br />
                    <h2>What is G20?</h2>
                    <p>G20 is a premier intergovernmental forum for international economic cooperation.G20 collectively comprises 19 countries along with the European Union. It was formed 23 years back on 26 September 1999. It includes both the world’s largest economies, like the United States and China, and developing nations, like India. These nations collectively hold nearly two-thirds of the world’s population and 60% of the world’s land area.</p>
                    <p>The topmost priorities of the G20 include Green Development, Climate Finance & Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE), Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and Women-led development.</p>
                    <p>India’s theme for the G20 presidency is - <i>‘One Earth, One Family, One Future’ – ‘VASUDHAIVA KUTUMBAKAM.’</i> </p>
                    
                    <h2>Functions of G20</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Previous G20 summits have addressed various critical issues like the Syrian civil war, the Iranian nuclear program, the 2008 financial crisis, and undoubtedly the Covid-19 pandemic.</li>
                        <li>The 2022 Bali G20 Summit deepened discussions on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some Western countries have been seeking to exclude Moscow, but China and Brazil completely denied the idea.</li>
                        <li>The three basic pillars which are most important to be considered post the global pandemic era are <b>health</b>, <b>digitalization</b>, and <b>sustainable ways of development</b>. In light of this, the leaders showed aggression in the deployment of Russian troops in Ukraine.</li>
                        <li>Food scarcity and uncontrollable rise in food prices are also one of main concerns. Currently, the main causes of it are the depreciating currencies in the developing economies and the Ukrainian war. </li>
                        <li>Also, one of the most important functions is to reduce tariffs and minimize barriers to promote Globalization.</li>
                    </ol>
                    

                    <h2>India’s role in G20 over a few decades</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            India has always been on the toes in the G20 preparatory process both at Sherpas Track and Financial Track. The Prime Minister of India has participated in all seven G20 summits.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The main goals of the Indian presidency would be to represent the aspirations of the larger Global South, promote sustainable socioeconomic growth, engage in diplomatic activism to protect the supply chains for food, fertilizer, and medical supplies from geopolitical upheaval, and engage in parallel discussions to reduce the threat of WMD and improve global security. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Startup20 Engagement Group will be established under India’s G20 Presidency for the first time, recognizing the role of startups in promoting innovation and scientific temperament among youth.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>New Opportunities?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The G20 presidency will allow following a more robust foreign policy by the Indian government. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has tremendously affected the relationship between Russia and other European countries over trade channels. PM Modi has proposed the idea of a ‘global common good’ for every nation.</li>
                        <li>India is a part of the G20 Troika, comprising Indonesia and Brazil. This would be the first time the Troika consisted of three developing and emerging economies.</li>
                        <li>The world will notice the shift of power from western countries to Asian countries. The decision-making authorities would be the emerging economies.</li>
                        <li>India will invite Bangladesh, Egypt, Mauritius, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Singapore, Spain, and UAE as guests. </li>
                        <li>Indian delgation in Bali G20 Summit was led by Indian diplomat Amitabh Kant who have held bilateral interactions with his visiting counterparts from Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, the UK, and the USA. It has been possible to infuse greater positivity and optimism in G20 deliberations in preparation for the Indian Presidency.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This summit is one of the most crucial summits outside the United Nations in the post-pandemic period.</li>
                        <li>The G-20 Presidency will be at the beginning of Amrit Kaal, the next 25 years after the 75th anniversary of India’s independence, which makes it both futuristic and inclusive.</li>
                        <li>As the world’s largest democracy, the third largest economy in the world in PPP terms, and 2nd most populous country, India will make a meaningful contribution to the G 20 to support faster, sustainable and inclusive growth.</li>
                        <li>The G-20 Presidency would place India on the global stage and provide an opportunity for India to set its priorities and narratives on the international agenda.</li>
                        <li>It would also provide a unique opportunity to showcase India’s progress and developments as well as its rich cultural heritage and diversity.</li>
