            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="lead drop-cap">
              The Department of Science & Technology(DST) is a division under
              the Ministry of Science & Technology of India. It aims to promote
              fields of science & technology and serve as a core department in
              the country to organize, coordinate, promote and facilitate the
              activities of science & technology. DST has introduced different
              streams that developed themselves with focused goals and
              priorities as divisions or even ministries. Some of them include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>DBT (Department of Biotechnology)</li>
              <li>DSIR (Department of Scientific and Industrial Research)</li>
              <li>MoEF (Ministry of Environment and Forests)</li>
              <li>MNRE (Ministry of New & Renewable Energy )</li>
              <li>MoES (Department of Earth Sciences)</li>
              <li>DoE (Department of Electronics)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Since its formation, it has introduced several programs towards
              the accomplishment of its goals. They include KVPY, Water
              Technology Initiative, Women scientist programs, Big data
              initiatives, Climate change programs, INSPIRE to name a few. Fund
              for Improvement of S&T Infrastructure (FIST) is one such program
              aiding scientific and technological development through
              infrastructural support.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a massive investment in creating science and technology
              infrastructure in the country, running into tens of thousands of
              crores of rupees every year. The Scheme “Fund for Improvement of
              S&T Infrastructure (FIST)” is intended to provide basic
              infrastructure and enable facilities to promote R&D activities in
              new and emerging areas and attract fresh talents in universities &
              other educational institutions. It allows departments/ Centres/
              Schools/ Colleges to pursue research activities more effectively
              and efficiently
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat is also incorporated by creating an
              R&D infrastructure not only for R&D activities in academic
              organizations but also for use by the start-ups/ manufacturing
              industries/ MSMEs. The beneficiary organizations are required to
              display a Public Notice exhibiting the FIST Logo and connect with
              the I-STEM (Indian - Science Technology and Engineering Facilities
              Map) portal to show the utility and availability of slots of
              different facilities in their premises.
            </p>
            <h2>Nature of Support</h2>
            <p>
              The Scheme provides optimal infrastructure facilities for
              post-graduate and higher research, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                the renovation of existing laboratory space (no fresh
                constructions) and cold room
              </li>
              <li>
                modernization of laboratories involved in PG and higher research
              </li>
              <li>acquisition of essential equipment</li>
              <li>
                up-gradation of existing facilities, networking & computational
                facilities including software & databases, scientific &
                technical books
              </li>
              <li>maintenance & refurbishing of existing and new facilities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The synergy and focus of research may preferably be aligned to
              National Missions/ priorities. The program intends to support the
              efforts of the Department as a whole or several faculty members in
              the Department. Proposal towards individual R&D support is not
              accepted under this Scheme.
            </p>
            <h2>Types of Support</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, there are four types of support corresponding to four different levels

                For any subsequent cycle of FIST support following the 1st cycle of help at any level, all beneficiaries are considered for a repeat cycle of FIST support only after 10 years from the date of sanction of the immediately preceding project

            </p>
            <h2>Benefits and Limitations</h2>
            <p>
              Since its establishment in 2000, the FIST Programme has spread
              over 3000 Departments/ PG Colleges across the Nation. On an
              average of about 8,500 researchers use these facilities in centres
              spread all over India.
            </p>

            <p>
              Industries and start-ups involved in research and development,
              technology, and product development carry out most high-end
              experiments and testing of technologies from laboratories outside
              India.This is because they prefer not to buy equipment and
              infrastructure that are of limited usage to them. They are unable
              to access most of the high-end science and technology
              infrastructure set up in the universities and institutions.
            </p>
            <h2>FIST 2.0</h2>
            <p>
              The FIST programme is being reinvented as FIST 2.0 to orient it
              towards ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ to create research and development
              infrastructure not only for experimental work but also to cater to
              theoretical work, ideas and entrepreneurship. The S&T
              infrastructure network is now reaching out to more beneficiaries
              and focusing on alignment with some of the National Missions and
              Sustainable Development Goals and towards technology translational
              research promoting different start-ups and industries.
            </p>
            <p>
              This will encourage Indian-origin researchers in research
              organizations worldwide and resident counterparts to explore
              collaborative joint ventures to strengthen India's science and
              technology base. It will also enrol the industry in research and
              development endeavours to bring about direct benefits for society.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              FIST has successfully aided the development of premier research
              institutes of the nation for over two decades. Now keeping up with
              the national requirements, it has shifted its focus to industrial
              research growth. The program will directly collaborate with other
              programs like Sophisticated Analytical & Technical Help Institutes
              (SATHI) and Sophisticated Analytical Instrument Facilities (SAIF)
              too. Keeping up with the overall national development goals like
              Aatmanirbhar Bharat and Startup India FIST will play a crucial
              role in expanding research and industrial output in India.
