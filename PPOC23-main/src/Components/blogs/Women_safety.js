                    <h2>What Happened that Night? </h2>
                    <p>
                        The nation was shocked ten years ago; on this day, 16th December 2012, a brutal rape and
                        assault occurred on a 22-year-old physiotherapy intern at the Munirka Locality of southwest
                        Delhi. She was traveling in a private bus with her male friend. Six perpetrators, including the
                        driver, brutally beat both of them, gang-raped Nirbhaya (as the victim is commonly known), and
                        threw out the victims from the moving bus. She was rushed to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi for
                        treatment and was later transferred to Singapore eleven days after the assault, where she died
                        due to her brutal injuries two days later.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Reactions and Trial
                    </h2>
                    <p>Widespread condemnation of the incident occurred in both India and abroad, and it received
                        extensive national and international media coverage. People protested against the government's
                        failure to provide women with security in the capital itself and thousands of protesters clashed
                        with the security personnel in New Delhi. Similar demonstrations were held across the nation.
                    </p>
                    <p>All the accused were arrested and one accused, Ram Singh, suicided in the police custody on 11
                        March 2013. On 10 September 2013, the four adult accused– Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, Akshay
                        Thakur, and Mukesh Singh – were found guilty of sexual assault and murder and were sentenced to
                        death. Both Delhi High Court and Supreme Court denied the convicts' appeal and upheld the
                        verdict. They were executed by hanging on 20 March 2020. The juvenile, Mohammed Afroz was
                        convicted of rape and murder and given the maximum sentence of three years imprisonment in a
                        reform facility, as per the Juvenile Justice Act.</p>
                    <h2>Government’s Action</h2>
                    <p>Following the attacks, many organizations criticized the Indian government to take appropriate
                        action. This included the United Nations Entity of Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women.
                        However the government took some steps to stop such incidents in future -</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Within six days, the Central government appointed a judicial committee to review the
                            criminal laws. This included issues such as ambiguity over the case process, conflict areas,
                            and maximum punishment.</li>
                        <li>In its 2013 Union Budget, the Indian government announced an INR 10 billion corpus fund
                            called the Nirbhaya Fund. This fund contributed to the empowerment, safety, and security of
                            women and girls. States can propose and implement new plans. Upon approval, the Nirbhaya
                            fund will finance the same. Unfortunately, by 2019, no state had utilized over 50% of the
                            sanctioned funds.</li>
                        <li>A new anti-rape law was brought in, which recognized the structural and graded nature of
                            sexual crimes against women and redefined rape to include all forms of non-consensual,
                            penetrative sexual acts that violated a woman's bodily integrity. The earlier law restricted
                            the definition of rape to peno-vaginal penetration.</li>
                        <li>Provisions were made in the law, making it mandatory for hospitals to give treatment to
                            victims of sexual assault and other offenses without waiting for the arrival of police.</li>
                        <li>Directions were issued for setting up of a one-stop center for rape complainants in at least
                            one hospital in each district of the national capital territory region.</li>
                        <li>A three-number helpline with phone number 181 was set up for women in distress.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Change in Situations?</h2>
                    <p>Even after implementing new laws and reforming the old ones the situation of rape and crimes
                        against women haven’t shown any progress Rather, there has been an increase in cases against
                        women.</p>

                    <p><em>According to statistics, a woman is raped in India every 16 minutes.[1] Isn’t it horrifying?
                        </em></p>
                    <div style={{"display": "flex;justify-content: center;"}}>
                        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fLtPH1Lf/image.png" alt=""/>
                    </div>
                    <div style={{"display": "flex;justify-content: center;"}}>
                        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TPZ0P1dn/image.png" alt=""/>
                    </div>
                    <p>Last year, police recorded 31,878 rapes - a steep rise from the previous year (28,153), although
                        compared to 2016, the numbers declined by 18%.</p>
                    <p> With tens of thousands of rape cases reported annually, India has earned the moniker "the rape
                        capital of the world."</p>
                    <p> Many other countries indeed report equal or higher numbers of rapes than India. Still, critics
                        say the world's largest democracy gets a bad name because of the way the victims and survivors
                        are treated and fall prey to the social stigma, and often, police and judiciary too act as mere
                        bystanders in these situations. It made global headlines when 2002 Gujrat Riot's gang-rape
                        survivor Bilkis Bano's convicts were released, reinforcing the view that India is often unkind
                        to women. </p>
                    <p> UP and MP showed an 80% increase in such cases. A cumulative national picture is also quite
                        abysmal. Pending rape cases and those related to the Protection of Children Against Sexual
                        Offences (POCSO) Act between the same period increased by over 77,000 – from 1,66,882 to
                        2,44,001.
                    </p>
                    <p>Major rape casses that shook the nation after the Nirbhaya Case - </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kathua Rape case</li>
                        <li>Unnao Rape case</li>
                        <li>Shakti Mills Case </li>
                        <li>Priyanka Reddy Case</li>
                        <li>Hathras Rape case
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Where did we fail?</h2>
                    <p>The Judicial system in India is one of the reasons why these cases keep on increasing. The long
                        procedural judicial system that gives justice has further led the victims to lose faith in the
                        judiciary of India. </p>
                    <p>According to the data taken from different high courts and subsequently released by the Union law
                        ministry, the pendency of such cases has increased by more than 46% across the country since
                        March 2018.</p>
                    <p> As per information received from High Courts, the status of pending cases related to rape and
                        the POCSO Act, as on December 31, 2019, is 2,44,001," Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad
                        informed the Lower House in response to a query by Janata Dal (United) leader Rajiv Ranjan
                        (Lalan) Singh.</p>
                    <p>The situation is much worse in many parts that usually, Law gives 60 days for rape cases, but the
                        Delhi court in itself takes 240 days for just the statement of the survivor.</p>
                    <p>Contrary to the stipulation in S.309(2), CrPC of completing rape trials in two months, it was
                        found the deposition of the prosecutrix (victim) alone was not completed within this time
                        period. The minimum time taken to complete just the testimony of the prosecutrix in our data was
                        77 days (2 months 16 days), with the average period being 37 weeks (8.5 months). </p>
                    <p>Victim shaming of rape accused leads to nonreporting of rape cases. Also, Cases show 99.3% rape
                        victims knew the survivors, in many cases their relatives or close ones, which makes it even
                        more horrific and challenging to fight for victims.Neither there is a provision for Marital Rape
                        cases in India nor there is conviction of Juvineille if he was involved in a crime.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Policy Suggestions</h2>
                    <p>Because of things like insensitive behaviour by the police and judges, lack of resources, and
                        faulty investigation, sexual assault survivors usually give up the legal battle.Poor
                        investigations in high-profile cases are frequently the result of the investigating agency's
                        lack of motivation; the Sengar case in Unnao serves as an example. However, the majority of the
                        time, the investigation is hampered by a lack of police resources, inadequate training for the
                        investigators, and gender insensitivity.There is a strong need to make this system efficient and
                        corruption free.
                    </p>
                    <p>Women who experience sexual harassment or violence do not always feel comfortable asking the
                        police or other authorities for assistance. The best way to solve this is to recruit more women
                        in the police.According to the most recent data available as of January 1st 2021, there were
                        2,17,026 women police officers in India. They made up just 10.5% of all police officers in the
                        nation as a whole. Women's representation has increased recently in the past years but at a
                        quite slow rate. India has been aiming to ensure at least one woman in every three police
                        officers for years now but needs to take more actions in this regard to achieve this early.
                    </p>
                    <p> Some of the other steps that should be taken at the earliest are - </p>
                    <ol>
         
                        <li>Identifying Criminal Hotspots in each city/district and keep vigil over them</li>
                        <li>Install camera in offices to prevent harassments in work</li>
                        <li>Ensure safety in Public Transportation</li>
                        <li>Gender Survey and Gender Sensitization across all sections of society</li>
                        <li>Promote Public Policing and spread awareness</li>
                        <li>Strengthen Cyber Police and keep vigil on social media to prevent cyber bullying</li>
                        <li>Formation of special sexual abuse court in each district

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Ray of Hope</h2>
                    <p>Every cloud has a silver lining! Although grim situations still exist, many improvements have
                        also been made in the last ten years. The National Council of Education Research and Training
                        has since developed textbooks and lesson plans focused on “gender sensitization,” which aim to
                        raise awareness of gender issues among schoolchildren. Delhi’s rickshaws and taxi drivers are
                        now required to take a gender sensitization course in order to renew their commercial licenses.
                        These two-hour classes focus on teaching the drivers how to respect and ensure the safety of
                        women passengers.</p>
                    <p>
                        Many people have become aware of sexual abuses against women and started NGOs and shelter homes.
                        One such example is Manisha Mashaal, A Dalit lawyer who runs a safe house called “Sisterhood
                        Home” at a secret location for these survivors, which aims to provide shelter to the victims as
                        they face social stigma and victim shaming from society. We hope if anyone again revists the
                        statistics after several years he or she would be able to do so with a gentle smile and
                        satisfaction.
                    </p>
